## ðŸ›  Prerequisites
Before attending the workshop, please ensure you have:
- A **GitHub account** ([sign up here](https://github.com/))
- Installed **Git** on your system ([installation guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git))
- A **terminal** or **Git Bash** (Windows users should install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/))
- A basic understanding of Unix shell commands. See [here](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/02-filedir.html)

### Why teach Git on the command-line (Unix shell) rather than with a GUI (Graphical User Interface)?:

- **Deep conceptual understanding** (the CLI forces you to perform each Git operation explicitly, so you see exactly how things work, whereas GUIs often bundle actions behind buttons, obscuring the underlying mechanics.)

- **Environment-agnostic skills** (the Unix-shell CLI is consistent across Linux, macOS, Windows (via WSL) and remote/headless systems(HPC servers), while each GUI client has its own interface and may not be available in all environments.)

- **Scriptability for reproducibility and automation**: (CLI commands can be composed into scripts or integrated into automated pipelinesâ€”key for reproducible research)
